        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a strategic HR Technology Leader with 6+ years driving
          large-scale transformations. Examples include successfully leading an
          organisation from manual processes to enterprise systems serving
          40,000+ users, and consolidating 84 disparate systems into streamlined
          technology stacks. I regularly engage with CHROs and CFOs to translate
          strategic priorities and problems into actionable roadmaps, building
          high-performing teams and delivering transformational change. My deep
          technical expertise in Workday configuration, reporting, integrations,
          and functional design enables me to lead teams effectively and
          mentorthem through complex technical decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe technology is only part ofthe story - great systems
          facilitate great processes, leadership, and culture. My holistic
          approach combines technical mastery with strategic influence,
          recognising that transformation requires organisational readiness,
          stakeholder engagement, and a people-first mindset. I thrive in
          environments where I can challenge the status quo and position HR
          technology as a strategic enabler of business success.
